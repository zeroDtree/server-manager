# Python Quality Checks

Before finalizing Python code changes, run both checks:

- `uv run ruff check`
- `uv run ty check`

Treat check failures as blockers:

- Fix all reported issues before considering the task complete.
- Re-run both commands after fixes to confirm a clean result.

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
uv run ruff check
uv run ty check

# ❌ BAD
ruff check
ty check
```
